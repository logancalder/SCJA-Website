        <section class = "about">
            <p>In recent years, we have noticed a crisis in the local Chinese churches in the U.S. Although the churches seem to be thriving now, many are facing a decline in the next twenty years.
                The main reasons are:

                <br><br>● Lack of deeper understanding and experiences of fundamental beliefs.
                <br><br>● Lack of transmission of spiritual inheritance between two generations of Chinese churches due to language and cultural differences.
                <br><br>● The church is divided into two categories:  the ministry staff is out of touch with the outside world, and the average layman lacks the necessary training for ministry.
                <br><br>● In the next generation, the Christian life lacks vitality and loses attraction. In the religionization of faith, one cannot spread the gospel efficiently.
                
                <br><br>In response to this concern, in addition to continuing the work we have done in the past, we are looking forward to focusing our efforts on the transformation of the church in the U.S. We need to make immediate changes in the people we serve (bilingual) and the environment in which we are located (Silicon Valley) to be able to build up suitable workers.
                
                <br><br>Therefore, we will be expanding our work to include the following:
                <br><br><br><br><b style = "font-size:x-large">Publishing Ministry</b>
                <br><br>● Making quality spiritual materials available in Chinese/English, hardcopy/softcopy (e-book and audio).
                <br><br>● We are collecting and arranging quality hymns and songs, making them suitable for contemporary use.
                <br><br>● Record testimonies of quality Christian lives so we can pass on examples to each generation of believers.
                
                <br><br><br><br><b style = "font-size:x-large">Training Staff</b>
                <br><br>● Train full-time church staff to face the challenges of technology.
                <br><br>● Most full-time church staff lack technology training, but the post-pandemic lifestyle has changed dramatically, and artificial intelligence will become necessary. Not only do ministry workers need to be equipped in the conceptualization and use of artificial intelligence, but they also need to take a step forward in leading the church to face the challenges posed by technology.
                
                <br><br><br><br><b style = "font-size:x-large">Sending Workers</b>
                <br><br>● We must send workers out of the church and into the community.
                <br><br>● The gospel must go out of the church and be present in the community.
                
                <br><br><br><br><b style = "font-size:x-large">Training believers to be ministers</b>
                
                <br><br>● To set up short-term ministry training courses according to the "Nazirite" principle so we can train believers according to biblical teaching and their gifts can be used in the church.
                
                <br><br><br><br><b style = "font-size:x-large">Cultivation</b>
                <br><br>● We must cultivate the next generation to become attractive Christians.
                <br><br>● The Chinese Church in North America has produced many offspring in the past half-century. However, most of our offspring are lost in the "pressure of academics" and the "pressure to succeed in their career." They have lost their higher and greater purpose in life. At best, they will become lifeless Christians who will lose their influence on society, just as salt loses its flavor and has no impact on the people around them.
                <br><br>The number of people coming to faith in Christ through the gospel decreases yearly. This past year, we held a summer program for high school students to explore goals and values for school, work, and life. We hope to continue this work with parents and young people to restore the appeal of Christianity and continue to spread the gospel.
